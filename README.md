This is the first tutorial that I found about a three-dimensional chess game, with my friends, we decided to implement and learn how can we make a chess game with some extras. [Tutorial by Mercenary Camp (Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmcbjnHce7SeAUFouc3X9zqXxiPbCz8Zp). 

This repository is my Assets folder that recently bugged, and I think it is a problem with Raycast [It could be found here](Scripts/Chessboard.cs). When I try to hover my mouse to change the Layer called `Tile` to `Hover`, it does'nt change at all. [Look what is happening](https://imgur.com/zFU5Y7M)

I've been Following step-by-step until a moment in the first video that messed it up. The biggest problem is that for some reason the Unity Console does not show me what error I need to solve.

I found some other people having similar issues, then I write it up my discord server. Until now I'm trying to figure it out.
