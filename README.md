This is the first tutorial that i found about a game chess three-dimensional [Mercenary Camp (Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmcbjnHce7SeAUFouc3X9zqXxiPbCz8Zp). 
Recently I'm bugged, and I think it is a problem with Raycast [It could be found here](Scripts/Chessboard.cs). When I try to hover my mouse to change the Layer called > Tile to > Hover, it does'nt change at all.

Following step-by-step until a moment in the first video that messed it up. The real problem is that the Unity Console does not show me what error I need to solve this problem.

I found some other people having similar issues, until now I am trying to figure it out.
